//Combined Changes from both branches
C.Preprocessor
In this project, I learned about common predefined macros in C while practicing implementing my own and include-guarding header files.

Tests 
tests: Folder of test files.

Tasks 
0. Object-like Macro

0-object_like_macro.h: Header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
1. Pi

1-pi.h: Header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
2. File name

2-main.c: C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.
3. Function-like macro

3-function_like_macro.h: Header file that defines a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
4. SUM

4-sum.h: Header file that defines a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
