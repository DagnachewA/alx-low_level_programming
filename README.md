## Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration fot one year, I learned and practiced about low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The list of projects are:

0x00. C - Hello, World
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
